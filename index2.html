        Sonnet of the Singing Birds

Beneath the muted colors of early dawn,
In nature's silence, a melody is gently spun.
Break not the bliss of the still, nor the soft light drawn,
Casting shadows ahead, announcing the day begun.

Fervently in the treetops, the birds celebrate,
Their enchanting song whispers through the air,
Find comfort in soft echoes they orchestrate,
Bringing life to the morning light's gentle glare.

Feathers of brightest red, yellow, sapphire and emerald hues,
Chasing the sky's path, in endless flight they wend,
From the eastern sunrise, to where the western light brews,
Their magic whispers to hearts, they effortlessly mend.

Soaring high or darting through the underbrush with pride,
In their sweet serenade, serenity and peace reside.

Admire them with joy, their flight, their vibrant perch,
Bearing witness to the elated choir within the church
Of towering trees and blooming flowers' care.
The monotone silence of the morn their songs dare quench,
And your heart shall listen, as these feathered friends,
This symphony of nature, tender messages to you dispatch.

Always acknowledge their call, sung from every twig, every branch,
In the world’s sweetest language, to which none can be a rival.
For in their refrain, the spirit of nature, elegantly capture,
The wonder of existence, and the joy of pure survival.

So, here ends the sonnet of the singing birds' daily lecture,
Pray silence for their song, let no clamor it ever fracture.
In the quiet of the dawn, their voices are the architecture,
Of peace and tranquility, which in our hearts, they ever manufacture.
